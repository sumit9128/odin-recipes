    <img src="images/mashedPotatoes.webp" alt="Image of mashed potatoes" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These mashed potatoes are too fattening to have on a regular basis. I only
      make these on holidays, and everyone wonders what's in them that's makes
      them so rich...
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
        paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1
        teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer,
        covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
